Have you ever heard about a friend whose image was stolen and used on a fake profile? It's a scary thought, and unfortunately, it happens more often than you might think. It's a terrible feeling to know that someone out there is using your image and pretending to be you. But there is a way to protect your images from being stolen and used without your permission. That's where Authenticity comes in. 

Authenticity is a blockchain-based image verification service that makes sure that all images are verified as real and that no one can use them without the right permission. With Authenticity, you can trust that your images are safe and secure. 

## What is Authenticity? 
Authenticity is a service that was created with the explicit concept that we should think about images being fake until verified by a trusted party. It uses blockchain technology to provide an immutable record of an imageâ€™s origin. This means that if someone tries to steal your image, it can be easily traced back to its source. This way, you can protect yourself from image theft and ensure that your images are always used with your permission. 

Authenticity also uses digital identity to verify that an image is authentic. This helps protect everyone from image theft, as the verification process makes sure that an image's origin is trusted.

## How Does Authenticity Work?
Authenticity uses a simple three-step process to verify an image. First, you upload the image to the platform. Then, the image is verified by the Authenticity team. Finally, the image is added to the blockchain and is securely stored. 

Once the image has been verified, it is added to the blockchain and is protected by a digital identity. This way, you can be sure that the image is authentic and can be trusted.

## Protect Yourself from Image Theft with Authenticity
Authenticity is a great way to protect yourself and your images from image theft. With its easy-to-use platform and secure blockchain technology, you can rest assured that your images are safe and secure. 

Authenticity is completely free and can be used by anyone who wants to protect their images from being stolen and used without their permission. So why not give Authenticity a try today and protect your images from being stolen?
