# Authenticity

Authenticity is an online blockchain-based photo validation tool designed to combat the rise of deep fakes. The free-to-use tool uses a unique hash code to verify the authenticity of images, making it easier to identify and combat fake news and other malicious activities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of Authenticity up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To get started with Authenticity, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the Authenticity repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/authenticity/authenticity-frontend.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can open the Authenticity web app in your browser. 

To verify images, simply upload the image and enter the corresponding hash code. If the code is valid, the image is verified!
