# WIP: Authenticity Frontend

Authenticity is an online blockchain-based photo validation tool designed to combat the rise of deep fakes. The free-to-use tool uses a unique hash code to verify the authenticity of images, making it easier to identify and combat fake news and other malicious activities.

This is very early stages and parts maybe broken, check back regularly for updates.
